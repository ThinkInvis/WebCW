### NOTE:
Most issues should use exactly one "progress" label, exactly one "severity" label, and at least one "type" label.
DO NOT mix "feature" and "bug" type labels.
Labels without prefixes are special and should be applied on a case-by-case basis. Some are used to add more specificity to the "type" label; others are used to mark significant issues (e.g. wontfix) or as metainformation for the issue system.
Please delete this note when submitting a new issue.
